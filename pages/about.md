# About Decoded Codex

<img src="/images/Home/DecodedCodex.jpg" alt="A open book written in an unknown language" id="site-image">

A personal project first launched on October 1st 2025, this website is actively under construction. I plan to update the website frequently, and there will be many changes over time.

I have studied many world religions and philosophies with a passion, and dedicated much of my time to learning the various paths and traditions of our world. I often find that many people are not familiar with many religions and philosophies, often leading to misunderstandings and separation between people and nations. My goal with this website is to build an easy to navigate catalog, that users can browse to grasp a better understanding of the many faiths and traditions of the world. I plan to arrange this site to be both accessible for those who just want a summary, a surface level inquiry, and also to those that would like to dive into deeper research.

May Wisdom find us all.
