# About

A personal projected launched solely by me, this website is freshly under construction. I plan to update the website frequently, and many new changes to content and layout will be common.

I have studied many world religions and philosophies with a passion, and dedicated much of my time to learning the various paths and traditions of our world. I often find that many people are not familar with most religions and philosophies, leading too often to misunderstandings and seperation between people and nations. My goal with this website is to build an easy to navigate catalog, that users can browse to grasp a better understanding of the many faiths and traditions of the world. I plan to arrange this site to be both accessable for those who just want a summary, a surface level inquiry, and to those that would like to dive into deeper research.

May Wisdom find us all.
