## Summary

A Buddhist is a person who adheres to the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha), viewing him as an enlightened teacher who discovered the path to liberation from suffering.

There are roughly 300 - 500 million adherents, making it the world's fourth-largest religion, although it may be classified as a philosophy instead depending on how it is practiced. Being a Buddhist can differ significantly between traditions, particularly regarding the nature of the Buddha, the methods of practice, and the specific scriptures held as authoritative.

## Early History

<!-- copy pasted template, need to heavily edit and revise below -->

Buddhism developed from the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama in the Magadha region of ancient India. The exact dates of his life are debated, but modern scholarship generally places his death between 483 and 400 BCE. The movement began as a sect of "Sramanas" (wandering ascetics) who rejected the authority of the Vedas and the caste system of Brahmanism. Siddhartha, a former prince who renounced his royal life to find the end of suffering, attained Enlightenment (Bodhi) under a Bodhi tree. He spent the next 45 years teaching the "Middle Way"—a path between extreme asceticism and sensual indulgence.

The movement initially consisted of a small group of monastic followers (the Sangha) who wandered with the Buddha, and lay supporters who provided them with food and robes. Unlike the political tensions surrounding early Christianity, the Buddha gained the patronage of powerful kings like Bimbisara and Pasenadi, allowing the Sangha to grow rapidly. However, the movement faced internal challenges. After the Buddha's death (Parinirvana), his teachings were preserved orally.

The First Buddhist Council was held shortly after his death to standardize the doctrine (Dhamma) and monastic discipline (Vinaya). While successful initially, disagreements over the strictness of monastic rules and the nature of an Arhat (enlightened being) led to the first major schism roughly a century later at the Second Buddhist Council. This split the community into the Sthaviravada (Elders) and the Mahasamghika (Great Assembly).

During the 3rd century BCE, under the patronage of Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan Empire, Buddhism transformed from a regional Ganges sect into a trans-regional religion. Ashoka sent missionaries as far as Greece, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Following this expansion, doctrinal interpretations continued to diverge, leading to the "18 Early Schools" and eventually the rise of the Mahayana movement around the 1st century BCE, which introduced new scriptures and the ideal of the Bodhisattva.

## Early Groups

<!-- copy pasted template, need to heavily edit and revise below-->

Differing philosophical interpretations led to the formation of several distinct schools in the early centuries:

The Early Disciples (The Original Sangha):

* The Sravakas: The direct "hearers" of the Buddha who aimed for Arhatship (personal liberation). They preserved the oral tradition of the Sutras and Vinaya.

* The Forest Dwellers (Aranyakas): Monks who preferred solitude in the wilderness over the settled communal life of the monasteries, emphasizing strict meditation and asceticism.

The Conservative Schools (Sthavira Lineage):

* The Sthaviravada: The "Teaching of the Elders." They emphasized strict adherence to the original Vinaya (rules) and rejected new doctrinal innovations. They are the ancestors of modern Theravada.

* The Sarvastivada: A highly influential school in Northern India. They taught that "all dharmas exist" in the past, present, and future (Pan-realism), creating a massive corpus of Abhidharma (philosophical analysis) texts.

* The Vibhajjavada: The "Distinctionists." They rejected the Sarvastivada view, arguing that only the present moment and unripened karma exist. This group eventually spread to Sri Lanka and evolved into the Theravada tradition.

The Majority Schools (Mahasamghika Lineage):

* The Mahasamghika: The "Great Assembly." They split from the Elders, arguing for a more flexible interpretation of monastic rules. They held a "supramundane" view of the Buddha, believing his physical body was a mere appearance, paving the way for Mahayana theology.

* The Caitika: An offshoot of the Mahasamghika in Southern India. They were known for worshiping stupas (reliquary mounds) and believed the Buddha was transcendent and beyond the laws of the world.

The Personalist Groups:

* The Pudgalavada: The "Personalists." A controversial group that argued for the existence of a subtle "person" (pudgala) that transmigrates between lives, which other schools attacked as contradicting the core Buddhist doctrine of Anatta (Non-Self).

The Early Mahayana Groups (The Great Vehicle):

* The Madhyamaka: Founded by Nagarjuna (c. 2nd century CE). They focused on the "Perfection of Wisdom" scriptures and the philosophy of Emptiness (Sunyata), arguing that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence.

* The Yogacara: Developing slightly later (c. 4th century CE), this school focused on the nature of consciousness. They argued that external reality is merely a projection of the mind (Citta-matra or "Mind-Only").
