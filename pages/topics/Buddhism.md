## Summary

A Buddhist is a person who adheres to the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha), viewing him as an enlightened teacher who discovered the path to liberation from suffering.

There are roughly 300 - 500 million adherents, making it the world's fourth-largest religion, although it may be classified as a philosophy instead depending on how it is practiced. Being a Buddhist can differ significantly between traditions, particularly regarding the nature of the Buddha, the methods of practice, and the specific scriptures held as authoritative.

## Early History

Buddhism developed from the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) in the region of ancient India and Nepal. The precise dates of his life are debated, but generally place his death between 483 and 400 BCE. Siddhartha was said to be a former prince who renounced his royal life to find the end of suffering, eventually attaining Enlightenment (Bodhi) in meditation under a Bodhi tree. He spent the next 45 years teaching his doctrines, including the "Middle Way", a path between extreme asceticism and sensual indulgence.

The movement initially consisted of a small group of monastic followers (the Sangha) who wandered with the Buddha, and lay supporters who provided them with food and robes. The Buddha gained the patronage of kings like Bimbisara and Pasenadi, allowing the Sangha (assembly) to grow rapidly, gathering several thousand followers. After the Buddha's death, his teachings were preserved orally, until eventually being written down in the 1st century BCE.

Differing interpretations over monastic rules and the nature of an Arhat (enlightened being) eventually led to the first major schism roughly a century later. This split the community into the Sthavira Nikāya (Elders) and the Mahāsāṃghika (Great Assembly), forming different opinions on several matters, particularly with rules to be obeyed.

During the 3rd century BCE, under the patronage of Emperor Ashoka of the Mauryan Empire, Buddhism transformed from a regional Ganges sect into a trans-regional religion. Ashoka is heavily credited with spreading Buddhism by supporting missionaries, providing donations, constructing pillars inscribed with moral principles, and building numerous Buddhist Stupas (shrines). Following this expansion, doctrinal interpretations continued to diverge. Around the 1st century BCE the Mahayana movement emerged as a distinct movement, with expanded canonical scriptures that presented the Bodhisattva path (attaining enlightenment for the benefit of all beings).
