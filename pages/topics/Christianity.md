## Summary

A Christian is a person who adheres to a religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, viewing him as a central figure of divine revelation and/or human salvation.

Estimates suggest there are about 2.3 - 2.6 billion adherents, with over 40,000 denominations and organizations of Christianity in the world. This makes Christianity the world's most popular religion, and one of the most diverse. What it means to be a Christian can differ vastly between groups, particularly regarding the Trinity, salvation, and doctrinal interpretation.

## Early History

Christianity, as it is called today, has gone through several events to shape it into the various forms it exists in now. Putting an exact time on when the religion of Christianity truly began opens up some debate. Theologically, it is most commonly accepted to have begun with the execution of Jesus (Yeshua ha-Notzri) and the interpretation of his role. The movement was primarily sparked by Jesus, attracting many members of Second Temple Judaism both during, and especially after his life. There were many followers of Second Temple Judaism at the time that were awaiting the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, including John the Baptist (Yochanan), who preached and baptized prior to the arrival of Jesus, having followers of his own sect already. Both Jesus and John the Baptist attracted followers early on, but also the attention of the then Roman administration. They were both considered a political threat as they amassed devoted followers in a relatively short period of time, thereby being considered as a potential uprising. Being considered leaders of fast-growing movements under Roman rule was enough to warrant their executions. Labeling Jesus as "King of the Jews" by the Romans was a mark of treason against their authority. This label was meant as a mockery and criminal charge, which became a catalyst for several members of the Jewish community at the time in the formation of Christianity. Jesus's role was interpreted in many different ways by early followers, such as that of a wise master, a messenger, a prophet, a Son of God, an incarnation of God, a fully divine being, a mortal man, and even an illusion of a material body (Docetic).

Peter (Cephas/Simon/Simeon) and James the Just (Ya'akov) both strongly continued to lead the movement after Jesus, along with many of the already amassed followers. They engaged in meetings with already existing, and soon-to-be followers in the Temples and private homes, particularly in Jerusalem and the surrounding area. Both Peter and James personally knew Jesus during his life, adding credibility to their message. At this time the movement was referred to as "The Way"; the term "Christian" was not used until several years later, originating in the city of Antioch. The early movement was still considered to be within much of the bounds of Judaism by the followers of "The Way", thus many Jewish laws such as Kosher diet and circumcision were still being practiced by the early members of the movement.

Paul of Tarsus (Saul) had at the time persecuted and sought to arrest the followers of the movement, before becoming converted himself after his proclaimed vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus. Barnabas (Yosef), donated large amounts to assist the early Jerusalem Church, and vouched for Paul to the early community. Barnabas and Paul had gone on some of the first missionary trips to spread the gospel throughout the region. Paul became responsible for other further developments, claiming that non-Jews should be welcomed into the movement, and that followers should be free from obeying many of the historical laws of Judaism. While there were people who welcomed these changes, others disagreed. Several disagreements occurred between Paul and James the Just, as James sought to continue the practices of Jewish laws, but made some compromises with Paul on the Gentiles. Paul appealed to many non-Jews, while James to the then Jewish-Christians. Both had considered themselves disciples of Jesus, but disagreed on several occasions on how to live and practice the religion. This continued between other followers of the forming religion, as several groups formed and split with their own doctrine interpretations.

By the 4th century, Christianity underwent a massive transformation following the Edict of Milan, transitioning from a persecuted sect to the state religion of the Roman Empire. This institutionalization led to the formalization of doctrine through Ecumenical Councils such as the First Council of Nicaea, which also sparked reactionary movements among those who felt the doctrine or teachings were compromised.

## Early Groups

Differing opinions by early followers was common, and several notable groups emerged early on such as:

Jewish-Christian Groups (Jewish Law Keepers):

* The Jerusalem Community: The original "Apostolic" circle led by James the Just; they remained within the framework of Second Temple Judaism, continuing to worship at the Temple and observe the Torah while following Jesus.

* The Ebionites: A Jewish-Christian movement that regarded Jesus as the human Messiah (denying his divinity) and insisted on the necessity of following the Jewish Law for all believers.

* The Nazarenes: Early Jewish followers who accepted Jesus’s divinity and the Virgin Birth but, unlike Gentile converts, continued to observe Jewish customs and rituals.

Universalist Groups (Free from Jewish Law):

* The Pauline Communities: Groups established by Paul of Tarsus that emphasized salvation through faith in Christ rather than adherence to Mosaic Law, paving the way for Christianity to become a global, non-ethnic religion.

* The Proto-Orthodox: The precursor to the "Mainstream" Church; they focused on apostolic succession, the four canonical gospels, and the developing doctrine of the Trinity to combat "heretical" movements.

Dualist and Esoteric Groups:

* The Gnostics: A diverse collection of groups who believed the material world was created by a lesser god (the Demiurge) and that salvation came through secret, intuitive knowledge (Gnosis) of one's divine spark.

* The Marcionites: Founded by Marcion of Sinope, they rejected the Old Testament entirely, arguing that the God of the Jews was a vengeful, lower deity and that Jesus was the messenger of a previously unknown God of Love.

Purity Seeker Groups:

* The Montanists: The "New Prophecy," they emphasized the immediate, ecstatic inspiration of the Holy Spirit and practiced strict asceticism in anticipation of the New Jerusalem.

* The Novatianists: Followers of Novatian who broke away from the church after the Decian persecution, refusing to readmit "the lapsed" (those who had renounced Christ under pressure) into the community.

* The Donatists: A North African group that argued the validity of sacraments depended on the moral purity of the priest; they rejected any clergy who had cooperated with Roman authorities.

Non-Trinitarian Groups:

* The Monarchians: A group that sought to protect the "Monarchy" (oneness) of God, either by suggesting Jesus was a human "adopted" by God (Adoptionism) or that Father, Son, and Spirit were merely different "modes" of one person (Modalism).

* The Arians: Followers of Arius who taught that the Son was a created being, subordinate to the Father, and not "co-eternal"—a view that triggered the Council of Nicaea.

Monastic and Ascetic Groups:

* The Desert Fathers and Mothers: Hermits and monastics who fled the increasingly institutionalized church for the Egyptian desert, seeking "white martyrdom" through prayer, celibacy, and extreme self-denial.

* The Cenobites: Early monastic communities that emphasized shared life, labor, and prayer, providing a structured alternative to the solitary life of the hermits.
