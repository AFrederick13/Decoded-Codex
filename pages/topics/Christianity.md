Christianity, as it is called today, has gone through several events to shape it into the various forms it exists in now. Putting an exact time on when the religion of Christiantiy truly began opens up some debate. Theologically, it is most commonly accepted to have begun with the execution of Jesus (Yeshua Bar Yosef). The movement was primarly sparked by Jesus, attracting many members of Second Temple Judaism both during, and especially after his life. There were many followers of Second Temple Judaism at the time that were awaiting the fullfillment of Old Testament prophecies, including John the Baptist (Yochanan), who preached and baptized prior to the arrival of Jesus. Both Jesus and John the Baptist attracted followers early on, but also the attention of the then Roman occupied territory government. They were both considered a political threat as they amassed devoted followers in a relatively short period of time, thereby being considered as a potential uprising. Being considered leaders of such a fast growing movement under Roman rule was enough to warrent their executions. Particularly regarding Jesus as being labeled as "King of the Jews" by the Romans was a mark of treason to them. This acted as an even bigger catalyst to the Jewish community at the time in the formation of Christianity.

Cephas (Simon/Simeon/Peter) and James the Just (Ya'akov), both prominetly continued the movement along with the already amassed followers. They engaged in meetings with already existing, and soon to be followers in the Temples and private homes, particually in Jerusalem and the surrounding area. At this time the movement was refered to as "The Way", as the term Christian was not used until later. The movement was still considered to be within much of the bounds of Judaism by the followers of "The Way", thus many Jewish laws such as Kosher diet and circumcision were still being practiced by the early members of the movement.

Paul of Tarsus (Saul) had at the time persecuted and sought to arrest the followers of the movement, before becoming converted himself after his proclaimed vision of Jesus. Paul was responsible for further developments, claiming that non-Jews should be welcomed into the movement, and that followers should be free from obeying many of the historical laws of Judaism. While there were people who welcomed these changes, others disagreed. Several disagreements occured between Paul and James the Just, as James saught to continue the practices of Jewish laws. Paul appealed to many non-jews, while James to the then Jewish-Christians. Both had considered themselves disciples of Jesus, but disagreed on several occasions on how to live and practice the religion.
